# **TEO** (**T**rust**E**THre**O**rigin) Blockchain

## TEO (PoW) blockchain is part of **TAO** Architectures.

## **TAO** (Trust Astro Object) '도' '道' '到' - all object in universe , it has its own philosophy and reason to existence and its own way of doing.

## **TAO** Archicture aim to be a space to platform for each other blockchain's connections.

It is not control whole things in one blockchain.
From beginning pow chain will be leading, but next period, pos chain will join with each independent chains.
and some other chain will be fork from each chains and they finished their roll, sink to parents chain.

in TAO , solve the scalablity and storage and network traffic reduces, mainly concern of **lifecycle and lifetime of blockchain**.

in TAO , besides of PoW chain, more lite chain will be implemented for very lite IoT devices.
for do that, SmartContract VirtualMachine will be developed direction with tightend to fit and run on small micom cpus.

Base idea of acheive this, Make not using highly abstacted instruction set computer, but adapt Real working cpu core instructions set. mainly considering instruction set is RISCV machine. also, OpenRISC instruction set machine is candidates.
There's no licenses and no IP risk instruction set machine will be adapted.

Second, in TAO adapt wide contents [blogging, music, UCC , forum, ...] archiving and rewarding platform.
It will be transfer to backend blockchain will be PoS based platform. in DAPP will run on mainly PoS based platform.

Fund states transfer method:
Recent blockchain tech has many useful way to exchange funds to another blockchains.
there's atomic swaps, smart contract based message driven methods, 2-way of side chaining methods.
mainly considering methods are smart contract based fund transfer methods. also, DEX (DeCentralized Exchange) is can do by 3rd party service providers.

### TEO is beginning of this TAO Architecture

## This directory cotains TEO testnet materials archives.

TEO Blockchain Spec:

1. NetworkID : 0x8888 (MainNet)
               0x8282 (TestNet)

2. PoW Algorithm : EtHash - CodeBase fork from Ethereum Parity Client.

3. TestNet v0.1 Lifecycle : ~ 1,000,000 blocks.
   at 1M block height, current testnet will suiside.

   Before 1M blocks, MainNet v0.1 and TestNet v0.2 will be launched. and then it will be more upgraded and live long.

4. Block Rewards : 5 TEO - same as original ethereum.

5. SSZ Funds (쌈짓돈-Ssamzi-don(money)) : 0.5TEO
 - it is for funds for developers and used for contents owner's rewards , like a Musicoin and Steemit.
first 0.5M blocks , it will owned by Devs and Founders, over 0.5M blocks it will be move to contents owners and community funds, ratio of 10%.

    - eg 
    -  0     ~  0.5M  block : 0.50 [Dev] : 0     [community]
    -  0.5M  ~  1M    block : 0.45 [Dev] : 0.05  [community]
    -  1M    ~  1.5M  block : 0.40 [Dev] : 0.10  [community]
    -  1.5M  ~  2M    block : 0.35 [Dev] : 0.15  [community]
    -  2M    ~  2.5M  block : 0.30 [Dev] : 0.20  [community]
    -  2.5M  ~  3M    block : 0.25 [Dev] : 0.25  [community]
    -  3M    ~  3.5M  block : 0.20 [Dev] : 0.30  [community]
    -  3.5M  ~  4M    block : 0.15 [Dev] : 0.35  [community]
    -  4M    ~  4.5M  block : 0.10 [Dev] : 0.40  [community]
    -  4.5M  ~  5M    block : 0.05 [Dev] : 0.45  [community]
    -  5M    ~        T.B.D

4. AirDrop Plan : 
So, snapshot on 5.8M ETH chain accounts will be airdroped by ratio of  
1 ETH with 0.1   TEO , minimum funds 0.01 ETH
1 ETC with 0.003 TEO , minimum funds 0.3  ETC

5. PoW algorithm change : Ethash will be modified for prevent Dominant ASIC mining.
But, if decentralized mining is guranteed , stay tuned to mining algorithms. it means there are several ASIC miner providers in market, and crowd of miners have choose mining devices then it is distributed and stay tune PoW algorithms.
